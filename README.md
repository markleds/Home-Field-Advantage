Home Feld Advantage is a forum for users to share advice, tips, experiences, likes, dislikes or general feelings for the different professional sports stadiums in North America. Users can create a new comment in 4 different categories (General, Parking, Food, Fan Experience). Users can like a comment if they found it helpful. This app is still in development. I hope to add more stadiums for the different professional sports leagues and allow users to log in and create a profile in an effort to make the app secure.
